        <small class="subtitle">Starting with no experience in JavaScript, I tried implementing some JavaScript into this site with the information I've learned this past week.</small>

        <p>
            Now, although I did start from nothing in JavaScript, I have plenty of experience in Java. After getting around the slight learning curve with JS's syntax, I got the hang of it. However, I did not truly understand the powers of the language until I began practicing in "about:blank". This allowed for me to see my code run line-by-line and actually understand what's going on much better.

        <h3 id = 'overview'>My Implementation</h3>
        <p>When I thought of what to create, I instantly thought that I should improve my blog section. Because it will be what I update the most out of everything, I want it to be as user-friendly as possible. As per the recommendation of my professor, I decided upon creating some button filters. Creating them were definitely not as difficult as I had expected. First, I needed to find a way to have all the blogs put into a list. After that, I implemented some CSS to make it look a bit nicer asthetically. Next, I needed to be sure the "Read More" buttons would stay with the respected blog post. After that, I started by having my JS function take in the list and save it as an array. Next, I took the substring of each element in the list so that I could extract the date. Once I got the date, I did the same with the next element. Finally, I simply compared the two dates and switched if the next element had an earlier date.</p>

        <p>
            Overall, the implementations have a lot of room for improvement. One thing I would like to implement is the opposite of those buttons once they are pressed. So, for example, "A-Z" would turn into "Z-A" after being pressed, and the same idea for "Most Recent". I hope to have these updates down within the next week if all goes as planned.
